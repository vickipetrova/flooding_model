# Flooding Model 
This project represents a Flooding model implemented using Cellular Automata and a complementary analysis. 

The model is generalizable to different regions and topogrpahies. The analysis here is focused on a vulnerable region in Bulgaria where every year thousands of people are affected by flooding. 

## Technologies and Lessons
I used the following technologies:

- Python
- Python numpy and matplotlib library

In this project I practiced and learned the following concepts:

- Cellular Automata
- Simulations
- Modeling
- Empirical and Theoretical Analysis 
- Creating data visualizations
